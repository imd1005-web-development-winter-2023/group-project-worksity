# Product Sketches

## Designs

<!--

Add the initial product designs that the team creates. Include a sketch for each web page or web app interaction.

Sketches can be done either with a pencil and take a picture of your designs and upload them, or through a tool like figma or tldraw.

The sketches don't need to be high fidelity or final, but should give the reader a good understanding of the scope of your project.

For example, if you are building an E-Commerce site, include a sketch for the home page, product page, category page, and checkout page.
