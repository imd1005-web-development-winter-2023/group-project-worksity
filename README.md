## Introduction

The group project is spread out over a four week period. During Week 1 project teams will have a kick-off session where participants form teams, work towards defining a specific problem, and then sketch out a solution to solve their identified problem. Week 2 and week 3 will involve development and testing of their solution. Week 4 will feature team innovation pitches during our final class.

All of your work must be submitted to your group project GitHub repository, and must be hosted through GitHub pages.
